Disease Prediction System
This project is a Machine Learning-based Disease Prediction System that predicts diseases based on user-provided symptoms. It uses three different machine learning algorithms to ensure accurate predictions and includes a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI).

Models Used:
Random Forest
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
These models are implemented using the scikit-learn library.
